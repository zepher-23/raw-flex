      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to <em><strong>RawFlex Calisthenics</strong></em>, where we believe in harnessing the power of your own body to achieve 
        optimal fitness and health. Our mission is to empower individuals with the tools, knowledge, and inspiration needed to

      </p>

      <h2>Our Journey</h2>
      <p>
        RawFlex Calisthenics was born out of a passion for fitness and a desire to break away from traditional, equipment-heavy 
        training methods. We saw a need for a more natural, holistic approach to fitness that emphasizes the strength and 
        resilience of the human body. From this vision, RawFlex Calisthenics was created, focusing on calisthenics and 
        bodyweight training as the foundation of our philosophy.
      </p>
